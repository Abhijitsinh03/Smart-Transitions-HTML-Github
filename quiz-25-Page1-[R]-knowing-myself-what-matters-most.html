                    <h2>Knowing Myself—What Matters Most</h2>
                    <p>Back in the exercise “Stacking the Deck,” you created check lists of important documents you will need as you transition into adult life and the workforce. You also created adult transition checklists for things you’ve experienced,
                        things you know how to do, and things that you know about. But, in order to create a really effective plan for transitioning to adult life, what you really need to know is who you” are.</p>
                    <p>You might ask, doesn’t everybody know themselves? Well, surprisingly, no. We know our names and we know certain biographical data about ourselves, but usually, if asked about what we are good at doing or what we have perfected skills
                        for or what we are passionate about or what things we value most, we fumble. But successful people think about these things and have answers to these kinds of questions.</p>
                    <p>This matters for several reasons. The first is that selecting a career or even a job without considering these questions is going to lead to a job that does not satisfy you or make you happy. Sometimes it might lead to a job that conflicts
                        with some of your core values. It can be a job that doesn’t match the kind of things you are good at doing and so will always feel unfulfilling. It might be a job that has little chance of meeting your aspirations for the kind
                        of life you want to live in a material sense. It can make the job that you spend 40 plus hours a week doing feel like torture.</p>
                    <p>The second reason is that part of what will make you successful at getting hired and landing the job or building the career you want is how well you know the answer to these questions. Job interviews are usually a mix of specific questions
                        about your skills and background and more open-ended questions about your values, your passions, and what you want out of life. Employers tend to hire people who are comfortable talking about themselves and who are able to frame
                        their life experiences in a positive way. If you’ve thought about these things you will be better prepared for your interview and be more successful at getting hired.</p>
                    <p>The third reason is one of the things you will create through this process is a personal presentation portfolio. This is kind of a secret weapon for job interviews and for getting hired. It will allow you to offer proof of the claims
                        you make about your abilities and experiences. But, in order to create one, you have to know what you’re best-selling points are. If you’ve thought about these things, you will know what kind of evidence and documents to gather
                        for your portfolio.</p>
                    <p>The fourth reason for having a strong sense of your own gifts, skills, passions, values, and aspirations is that it will make you more confident and self-assured. We tend to be attracted to people who are confident and seem to know
                        themselves well. That is true for employers who make the decision to hire someone or not and it is also true for supervisors, colleagues, co-workers, and clients. Healthy self-esteem is grounded in self-awareness.</p>
                    <p>In the tasks coming up, we are going to ask you to think about your aspirations, your gifts or talents, your skills, your passions, and your values.</p>
                    <p>To complete this reading, answer the questions below (and yes, you can scroll back and look for the right answer if you need to).</p>
                    <p>Identify the following statements as true or false based on the reading above:</p>
