                    <h3>What is a Personal Brand?</h3>
                    <p>Okay, this is pretty simple and may seem obvious, but it is really important to your success in life. Your personal brand is your reputation.</p>
                    <p>How do you want to be thought of and talked about by your friends, your peers, your community? What qualities do you want people to associate with you? If you had only three words to describe yourself what would they be? Talented?
                        Creative? Energetic? Motivated? Friendly? Smart? Attractive? Loyal? Enthusiastic? Honest? Passionate? Organized? Committed? Are you a natural leader, a great salesman, a powerful communicator, an empathic listener, a quick learner?
                        Do you have a great sense of style, good people skills, an eye for detail?</p>
                    <p>These are or could be aspects of your personal brand. We all have a brand (reputation), whether we think about it or not. If we are not paying attention to our brand, we may be allowing ourselves to be defined by our worst habits.
                        If we are ignoring our brand we are wasting an opportunity. People form opinions about us even when we are not conscious of creating a brand. </p>
                    <p>Your brand is essentially what you have to offer or sell to the world. It is or should be the “best” you that you have. It is how people think about you. It is what they associate with you when they see you or see your picture or hear
                        your name. You may be more familiar with commercial products like Nike® or Mercedes Benz® or Coca Cola® or Apple® or Polo®. These are very carefully cultivated brands. Nike doesn’t just want you to think about shoes when you see
                        their logo. They want you to think about athletic effort, excellence, and achievement. Mercedes Benz doesn’t just want you to think about cars when you see their logo. They want you to think about luxury, wealth, and class. Apple
                        doesn’t want you to think about computers or phones, they want you to think about cutting edge technology encased in beautiful design and elegant form. </p>
