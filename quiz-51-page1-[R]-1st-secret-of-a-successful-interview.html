                    <h2>1st Secret of a Successful Interview</h2>
                    <p>Remember that in the reading “What is a Work Brand?” We talked about three things that led people to get hired. Employers hire people who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Appear Qualified;</li>
                        <li>Look Attractive;</li>
                        <li>Stand Out as Memorable in a Positive Way.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The reality of hiring and being hired is that a lot more people apply for a job than can be hired. That means employers need to make the process as efficient as possible so they narrow the applicants down in roughly three steps. The
                        first step is to determine if you have the basic qualifications you need to do the job. In entry level positions where they will need to train you to do the job they want to hire you for, they will select people first based on
                        their employment application. This will eliminate people who can't follow simple instructions and give them some sense of how much general work experience you have had.</p>
                    <p>But, the second step is what occurs at the job interview. They may have narrowed 30 applicants down to the 10 they are going to interview. At the interview, they will be looking for the kinds of things that you highlighted in the process
                        of developing your work brand (elevator speech). The challenge here is to frame your best assets, your strengths and character qualities in a way that makes you seem well qualified for the job.</p>
                    <p>Sooner or later, all job searches come down to how well you do on an interview. That means how good you are at presenting your work brand and how well your brand aligns with the needs of an employer. A successful interview is always
                        about solving a potential employer’s problem. Your problem, as a job seeker, is that you need or want a job. That’s not the employer’s problem. The employer has another problem, to which you might or might not be the solution.
                        A successful interview means presenting yourself as the most attractive solution to the employer’s problem. That means you, as an interviewee, need to present yourself as being qualified, attractive, and memorable.
