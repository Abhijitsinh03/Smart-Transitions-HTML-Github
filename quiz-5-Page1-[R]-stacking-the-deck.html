        <h2>Stacking the Deck</h2>
        <h3>What can I do to be better prepared for adult life and independence?</h3>
        <p>Since you can’t change the laws that define adulthood, and you can’t really speed up your biology or brain development, and how other people choose to see you is beyond your control, the smartest move would be to focus on your behavior and the choices you do have some control over.</p>
        <p>In the reading “What Makes Someone an Adult?,” remember how we said that 18 is not a magical number? Well, that’s true, but it is an important number. It’s considered the age of emancipation, which means the age at which you can legally choose to leave your parents’ home and live on your own. For some young people, there is no rush to move out or need to be prepared. They may gradually transition out of being financially supported by their families and living in their parent’s home by attending college and living in a dorm or apartment or by joining the military. For other young adults, this transition age can be more critical. Youth in foster care or already in a temporary living situation may need to move out, or, more importantly, be prepared to move out.</p>
        <p>So how does one really prepare for the challenges of adult life? When you play cards, if you “stack” the deck it means that you are setting the deck up in such a way that you will get dealt a winning hand. Card games are supposed to be games of chance and “stacking the deck” during a game would be cheating. But, in life, if there was a way to ensure that you were better prepared to deal with adulthood, and you utilized it, that wouldn’t be called cheating, it would be called “smart.”</p>
        <p>In the tasks ahead we will explore four ways you can stack your own “independence” deck. <strong>D.E.C.K.</strong>, in this case, becomes an acronym for gathering essential personal <strong>Documentation</strong>, having key life <strong>Experiences</strong>, developing <strong>Critical Skills</strong>, and acquiring <strong>Knowledge</strong>. Each of these things are keys to a successful adult transition. As an adult you will be expected to have certain documents and paperwork. Know what these things are and acquiring them in advance can make your life much easier. It’s also true that certain life experiences prepare you well for the challenges and opportunities of adult life. If you know what they are, you can arrange to have those experiences in your teen years. There are also some skills that tend to be critical for adult life. Some of these things you will learn as the need arises, but others are skills you could acquire in advance, making your transition less stressful. Finally there are certain kinds of information (things you should know about) that make adult transition safer, healthier, and happier.</p>
        <p>The next four tasks will provide you with handy check lists to track your progress in acquiring documents and life experiences as well as developing critical skills and accessing knowledge. Don't worry about how many items you can check off the list right now. Check off the ones you have or have already experienced or acquired. Then, revisit the checklists regularly (they can be found under the checklists tab on your dashboard). As you see more and more items checked off your lists it will give you a good sense of how well prepared you are for adult life and independence.</p>
        <p>To complete this reading, answer the question below (and yes, you can scroll back and look for the right answer if you need to).</p>
