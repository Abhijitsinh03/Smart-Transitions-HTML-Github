                    <h2>So how do I get my evidence and samples into the gallery?</h2>
                    <p>There are two steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Converting a document to digital form</li>
                        <li>Uploading that document</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Step 1: Digital Conversion</h3>
                    <p>If your document is not already in digital form (like an image from your cell phone camera or a document you created and saved on a computer), you will need to scan it and save it as a JPG.</p>
                    <p>You can do this with a desktop scanner attached to a computer. If you don't have one at home, you can ask a computer/technology teacher at school about getting some documents scanned. You can also sometimes rent computer and scanner
                        time at FedEx Office stores.
                    </p>
                    <p> Another alternative is to use your camera on your cell phone. We suggest you download a scanner app for your cellphone. Do a search for scanner apps and download one that works with your phone. These apps are usually free for the basic
                        functions, which should be all you need. They can convert text documents into PDF files, which is something most built-in camera apps can't do. There are many applications to choose from, but they all work in the same basic way.
                        Some of the most popular scanner apps include Tiny Scanner (for Android and iOS) and Scanner Pro (iOS) but you can also search your device's app store to find even more options.</p>
                    <p>Cell phone apps are helpful because they usually correct images to make them appear square even if your photo was crooked. They also let you crop your image to eliminate the borders of whatever your document was laying on. Then they
                        let you save the document in an appropriate format and save it to a file from which you can email it or upload it.</p>

                    <p>Your portfolio cover page would be back-to-back with your headshot slipped into the same clear page holder. Facing your portrait would be your resume with your references sheet facing out on the back side. When you complete this course
                        you will get a certificate of completion for this program. You might want to save the space opposite your references for this certificate, but that’s up to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>After that, you will want to begin with one of your “Who I Am” statements. Then insert all the evidence you have (letters of recommendation, photos, awards, certificates, programs, press clippings, inventory sheets, etc.) that supports
                        or backs up that first “Who I Am” statement.</p>
                    <p>Then you repeat that process until your portfolio is full or you have used all the evidence you have. By the way, it’s okay if your portfolio isn’t full when you start out. It’s a work in progress and it will grow over time. After
                        you have created your first portfolio, it’s fine to reorganize it in different ways as long as it tells your story in a compelling way.</p>
