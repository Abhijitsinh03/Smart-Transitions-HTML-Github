                    <h2>Professional <span><i> (Doctors, Lawyers, Scientists, Teachers, Engineers, C.P.A.s, Business Executives)
                        </i></span></h2>
                    <p>Generally speaking, higher paying professional careers require more education and training.</p>
                    <p>Doctors, lawyers, professors, scientists, engineers, designers, teachers, therapists, business management and marketing professionals, and accountants (to name only a few of the many career possibilities) all require between 4 and
                        10 more years of higher education (college, medical or law school, or graduate school).</p>
                    <p>If you have a real passion for a field of study and want to learn more, you are probably already thinking about college. You can start out in a 4-year college or university or begin in a 2-year community college and transfer to a 4-year
                        school to complete your degree. Community college can save you a lot of money and, regardless of how well you did in high school, you can get into a community college and once you get in, you have a clean slate academically.</p>
                    <p>College is not easy and it is not cheap, but if you think you can use college to your advantage, it is one of the best investments you will ever make in your own future and in your own earning potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some sample technical career paths.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>I want to be a pediatrician:</b>4 years of college (Bachelors Degree in biology), followed by 4 years of medical school, followed by a 4-year internship (practical medical training).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>I want to be a social worker: </b> 4 years of college (Bachelors Degree in psychology/sociology), followed by two years of graduate work (Masters Degree), plus certification training.

                        </li>
                        <li><b>I want to be a lawyer:</b> 4 years of college, followed by 2 years of law school.</li>
                        <li><b>I want to be a scientist/professor: </b> 4 years of college, followed by 2 years for a Masters Degree, followed by 3 to 5 years for a Doctoral Degree. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>The Next Step For a Professional Career:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make a list of colleges and universities where you can get the training you need. Don’t narrow the list down too much to start with. Begin with more choices.</li>
                        <li>Find out what each school will cost. You may be surprised at how much difference there can be</li>
                        <li>Research your financial aid options. <u>See if your school or area has an organization that helps cover the cost of college and make an appointment to speak with him or her.</u> Financial aid can be confusing. Make sure you understand
                            any documents you are asked to sign and what you have to pay back. Don’t assume that you can’t afford college, but, at the same time, be realistic about the cost of tuition, books, fees, room and board on campus (or an apartment
                            and living expenses off campus). If you will have to work part-time to pay for school, don’t let your grades slip.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Financial aid for college-terms you should know:</h3>
                    <ul>

                        <li><b>Scholarships: </b><u>Money for school that you don’t have to pay back,</u> usually awarded because you are good at something the school you want to go to values (like athletics or academics). Scholarships are often competitive
                            and sometimes are awarded by charitable organizations and community groups.</li>
                        <li><b>Grants:</b><u>Money for school that you don’t have to pay back,</u>usually awarded because of financial need (like Pell Grants).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Work-Study:</b><u>Money for school that you don’t have to pay back,</u>given to you in exchange for doing a particular job on campus (like working in a school book store).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Student Loans: </b><u>Money for school that you do have to pay back.</u>You have to pay back what you borrow whether you finish school or drop out, but you don’t have to start paying back your student loans until after you graduate.
                            Be careful about taking on too much debt to pay for college, but don’t be afraid of having some debt. If getting a degree is going to allow you to have a high-paying career, then it is probably a good investment.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
