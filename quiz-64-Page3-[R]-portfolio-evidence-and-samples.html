                    <h2>Awards, Certificates, Press-Clippings, Programs from Performances </h2>
                  
                    <p>If you have received awards for achievement, consider including them in your portfolio. Even if the award just attests to your participation, it is worth including. If you have made the honor roll, achieved academic or athletic excellence, or had perfect attendance, these are also things worth noting. Have you ever been an employee of the week, month, or year? Make sure to include any documentation of such accolades. Have you ever won a prize? Whether it was for correct spelling, outstanding artwork, or breaking the record on a video game, if someone has taken notice of your achievement, include this in your portfolio. Physical fitness awards, sports trophies, and athletic letters count too.</p>

                    <p>Certificates are also important. They demonstrate a couple of important things. First, they provide proof of a skill. They show you have completed a training program in some specific skill, usually something of your choosing. This suggests that you are proactive and committed about your education and training. It also demonstrates your follow-through and ability to complete a course of training.
                        </p>
                    <p>If you have been mentioned in a positive way in a newspaper article, even in just the school paper or a system-wide newsletter, cut it out and save it. Save pictures of you that have appeared in print. Don’t limit your collection to school-related or academic activities. Church, community, or social activities that have brought you recognition should be included.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if you are involved in a performance, like a play or concert and are featured in a program for that performance. Include some of those programs in your portfolio. </p>
            
                <p>It may not seem fair, but things such as awards, official certificates, and press clippings have a lot of weight in a portfolio. They are like having witnesses with you in an interview to attest to the honesty of your claims. If you have received an award but misplaced it, it is important enough to go back to the source of the award to request another copy. If you have no clue where your old awards and certificates are, ask your parents. Moms are famous for saving things like their children’s awards and certificates.
