                    <h2>What’s the relationship between work, money, and happiness?</h2>

                    <p>The average work day is 8 hours long. If you are a professional with a lot of responsibilities you sometimes put in more hours than that. If you need to work more than one job just to make ends meet then you will probably also work more hours of your day. But let’s start with an 8-hour work day.</p>

                    <p>Let’s assume it takes you an hour to get ready for and get to work, you get an hour for lunch, and then it takes an hour to get home and change clothes. That’s 11 hours devoted to work so far.</p> 

                    <p>If you do even minimal cooking or meal preparation for yourself or your family, you’ve probably used up another hour. Give yourself a half hour of personal time in the bathroom. You’ve now used 12.5 of your 24 hours.</p> 

                    <p>Let’s assume you sleep 8 hours a night. So before getting any personal time in your day you’ve used up 20.5 of your 24 hours. Chances are that your home is going to require some maintenance and you’re going to have to clean dishes, empty trash, make beds, do laundry, clean the bathroom, etc. Unless you dedicate your weekends to all these chores, you’re going to be spending another hour a day on some of them.</p> 

                    <p>If you have children or a partner, chances are they are going to want some of your time as well. That’s another 2 hours, <strong>so now you may have 1.5 hours a day left to do everything you personally enjoy.</strong></p> 

                    <p>So much of your day is going to be taken up with work. If you end up doing something you dislike, you’re not going to be happy. Why not spend those 40 plus hours each week doing something you enjoy? Why not spend it doing something that makes you happy?</p>

                    <p>People who both love what they do and make a lot of money doing it report being the happiest. But, people who don’t make a lot of money, but are doing work they love, are also pretty happy. On the other hand, people who hate what they do, even while making a lot of money are seldom very happy, and hating what you do and not making much money is a recipe for being miserable.</p>
