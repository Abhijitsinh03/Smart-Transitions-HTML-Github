        <h2>What is a mentor?</h2>
        <p>Ask any successful adult about what led to their success and aside from a healthy combination of hard work, a positive attitude, and good luck, they will also probably mention that person or people who coached them, advised them, or believed in them in a way that made a difference. They had mentors.</p>
        <p>Mentors are like coaches, teachers, counselors, or advisors. In movies like the original Star Wars films, Luke Skywalker had both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda as mentors and in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies, the characters had Gandalf as a mentor, Harry Potter had Professor Dumbledore and the Karate Kid had Mr. Miyagi or Mr. Han (depending on which version we’re talking about). Professor Charles Xavier was a mentor to the mutant students in X Men and Iron Man became a mentor to Spider Man in The Avengers films. Coach Boone was a mentor to the young men on his football team in Remember the Titans and Coach Ken Carter was a mentor to his basketball team in the film Coach Carter. Katniss Everdean had Haymitch in The Hunger Games, the Banks children had Mary Poppins, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had Splinter. Rocky had Micky and then Apollo Creed’s son had Rocky as a Mentor. Neo had Morpheus in the Matrix films and James Bond had M. Even Tyler Perry’s Madea manages to be a pretty good mentor to the young people in her life.</p>
        <p>A mentor is someone older than you who has had more significant life experience. A mentor is not your buddy or your boyfriend or girlfriend. A mentor is not your peer. A good mentor will bring three great gifts to your relationship:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>They’ve been though what you have yet to face and can be good guides when you are stuck, frustrated, or losing hope.</li>
          <li>They will be honest with you. Your friends will tend to tell you what you want to hear. They care about you, but they will want to remain your friend. They also can't give you very good advice about things they have not yet experienced. A mentor is committed to your success in life.</li>
          <li>They will hold you to your word. If you say you want to accomplish something, they will take you at your word and offer sincere help and guidance. A mentor, like a good coach, will push you when you need to be pushed.</li>
        </ol>
