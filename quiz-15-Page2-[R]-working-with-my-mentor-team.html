        <h2>Here’s some tips for utilizing your mentor team effectively.</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Most of the questions you will have in this process can be answered equally well by anyone on your team, though the answers might be slightly different. So, ask your questions to your team.</li>
          <li>If you think that one of your mentors might have specific expertise that would give you a better answer, then ask that person directly in your chat message box.</li>
          <li>Your mentors may congratulate you for earning badges or making progress or accomplishing goals. Thanking them builds your relationship. Expressing gratitude and respect reinforces their commitment to your success.</li>
          <li>A good friend or family member may have a commitment to you, but a good mentor or coach will have a commitment to the vision or goal or objective you’ve identified. There is a difference. It is not their job to build up your self-esteem. It is their job to ensure that the self-esteem you have is based on your choices and your actions and that those actions actually move you closer to your goal.</li>
          <li>A mentor is also not a therapist or a counselor. If you are having challenges related to your life-work plan or moving into the world of work or even how education and training and work itself works, those are great questions for your mentor team. If you feel like issues such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse or other mental or physical health issues are impacting you negatively, that isn’t something your mentors are equipped to address, regardless of how much they may want you to succeed.</li>
          <li>There will be some tasks that will require your mentors to sign off on before they can be made public. For example, you will be asked to share a draft of your resume with your mentor team before you can publish it. This will help ensure that spelling and grammar are correct and that the things you’ve included put you in the best possible light. In some cases, your mentor team (especially if one of your mentors is a parent or guardian) may suggest including awards or experiences or skills that you may have missed. If your mentor does not respond within three days. Feel free to use your message board to remind them to take a look at it.</li>
          <li>In some tasks, your mentor may be looking for things that might be inappropriate in a portfolio of URL page. Those things might be inappropriate for a variety of reasons but what is important here is to remember that they are trying to ensure that whatever documents you make public reflect well on you. Please take that feedback seriously.</li>
          <li>Don't ask your mentors for face-to-face meetings unless you already have a regular face-to-face relationship with them outside of this process. Also, if you ask your mentor for help with something, please remember that they are busy people and may not be able to respond right away.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The important thing to remember is that you don't have to do this alone.</p>
        <p>Sometimes mentor and mentee relationships don’t work out for no fault of the mentor or the mentee. Sometimes a mentor realizes he or she has taken on more responsibility that is comfortable or a new situation has arisen at home or at work that keeps them from being able to honor their commitment. There is no shame in this and you should not take it personally. Sometimes a mentor may feel she or he has given you all the help they are capable of providing and it is time to replace them.</p>
        <p>This program is designed to continue beyond high school and into job training, apprenticeship, or college. The help of a mentor team as you continually refine and revise your plans and documents can be invaluable. Especially as you get close to seeking employment in the career of your choice. That may be another reason for replacing mentors.</p>
        <p>But even if you need to replace a mentor because he or she has just been unresponsive, make sure you thank them for the time they have given you when you suggest that it may be time to end that particular relationship. One of the best life lessons you can learn now is how to close a chapter of your life or end a relationship without burning bridges behind you.</p>
        <form>
          <p>If you need to replace a mentor, just return to the task titled “Inviting my Mentor Team” located under the <input type="text" name="text" aria-label="text"> tab on your dashboard, and replace an existing mentor with a new invitee.</p>
        </form>
        <p>To complete this reading, answer the question below (and yes, you can scroll back and look for the right answer if you need to).</p>
        <p>Identify the following statements as true or false based on the reading above:</p>
