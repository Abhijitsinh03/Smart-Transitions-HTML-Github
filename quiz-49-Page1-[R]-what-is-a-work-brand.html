                    <h3>What is a Work Brand?</h3>
                    <p>Let’s start where we left off in the last reading. People who find jobs easily are people who present themselves to others well and make a good impression. They understand that employers hire people who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Appear Qualified;</b></li>
                        <li><b>Look Attractive;</b></li>
                        <li><b>Stand Out as Memorable in a Positive Way.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We’ll address looking attractive and standing out as memorable in future readings and tasks, but the first hurdle is that you appear qualified. You can think of it like this. There is one opening available and 20 people are applying
                        for it. That means that an employer needs to cut down that list from the very start and where they usually start is with employment qualifications. If the job requires specific skills, degrees, or certifications, you will probably
                        know that up front and will either have or not have those skills, degrees, or certifications. But most entry level jobs at the part-time level don't require specialized skills. They do, however, all require certain “soft” skills
                        and the first cut an employer will make is those people who can't or don’t demonstrate those soft skills.</p>
                    <p>That’s why your work brand is important. A work brand is like a personal brand but more focused on qualities that an employer would value (as opposed to a friend or partner).
                    </p>
                    <p>The smart job searcher and career builder focuses on developing the skills and qualities that employers value most (see below). These are your success skills. They will help you through your entire career not just in landing a job.
                        But, it’s not enough to acquire skills, you also need to be able to highlight those skills when asked about them. It’s also not reasonable that anybody would be outstanding in all areas, so effective job seekers highlight the four
                        or five that they are really able to demonstrate in a strong way.</p>
                    <p>In 2010, the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) published a list of the what skills employers are most interested in their employees having. The list is in order of importance or preference, but all of them are strong
                        success skills that could make someone an attractive hire. </p>

                    <ol class="new-ol">
                        <li>Communication Skills</li>
                        <li>Strong Work Ethic</li>
                        <li>Initiative</li>
                        <li>Interpersonal Skills</li>
                        <li>Problem-Solving Skills</li>
                        <li>Teamwork Skills</li>
                        <li>Analytical Skills</li>
                        <li>Flexibility/Adaptability</li>
                        <li>Computer Skills</li>
                        <li>Detail-Oriented</li>
                        <li>Leadership Skills</li>
                        <li>Technical Skills</li>
                        <li>Organizational Skills</li>
                        <li>Self-Confidence</li>
                        <li>Tactfulness</li>
                        <li>Friendly/Outgoing Personality</li>
                        <li>Creativity</li>
                        <li>Strategic Planning Skills</li>
                        <li>Entrepreneurial Skills</li>
                        <li>Sense of Humor</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So what does that mean for you? It means that you should be using high school and college or technical training as an opportunity to build and refine these skills. It means that you should be gathering evidence of your ability to apply
                        these skills to work situations. You can either spend your time complaining that people won’t give you a break or spend your time becoming the kind of person employers can’t resist hiring.</p>
