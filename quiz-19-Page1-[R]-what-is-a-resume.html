        <h2>What is a Resume?</h2>
        <p>A resume is (usually) a single page that lists some of the most important information an employer will want to know about you. If you are older and been working a long time in a variety of positions, your resume may extend to more than one page, but, in general, one page is best.</p>
        <p>Some resumes may include different things, but what all resumes share in common are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact information (your name, address, telephone number and email address). If an employer was interested in hiring you or interviewing you, how would he or she contact you?</li>
          <li>Your educational background. Usually this means schools attended and degree earned. Once you’ve earned a degree from a college or a certification from a vocational or professional skills program, you can usually drop the high school attended and degree earned, but in the beginning it is still important. This is also the place to mention any academic honors or special diploma that you graduated with.</li>
          <li>Your work experience. This can include paid work experience, volunteer work experience, or even self-employed work experience. This is arguably the most important part of the resume. The most important part of each employment listing is what your duties were. Even better, express them with adjectives. Instead of saying “waited on customers,” try “provided friendly and personable customer service.” Instead of saying “cleaned restrooms,” try “maintained high levels of cleanliness.” Instead of saying “worked multiple stations,” try “demonstrated efficiency and flexibility in duty assignments.”</li>
          <li>Remember that volunteer work experiences and internships can make you appear very attractive even though you may not have much paid work experience. Think proactively! If you can't find paid work, volunteer.</li>
          <li>Certificates and Awards. If you’ve earned them, highlight them on your resume. Generally speaking, the more local the award the more recent it should be. Academic Achievement, citizenship, sports awards, etc. can go back about two years. A national award like National Honor Society has a longer life.</li>
          <li>Membership. This is less common but if you are a member of a student organization that reflects well on your commitment to your career, you could include that. The Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) would be examples</li>
          <li>Skills. If you have general or specialized skills such as a foreign language, or computer expertise, or first aid or life-saving training, those would be worth highlighting.</li>
          <li>Summary Profile. This is not always necessary but can be helpful in shaping someone’s opinion of you. A summary profile is one or two sentences describing your best qualities and why you are applying for a particular job.</li>
        </ul>
