        <h2>SUPPORT NETWORK: Who can you turn to for help?</h2>
        <p>The gantry and tower beside the rocket in the diagram represents your support network. These are the people that can help make your dream come true and your plan a reality. A support network is that group of people you can turn to for help and guidance. They won’t be able to give you your dream, but they will assist you in vital moments and in vital ways. This can include parents, family members, and friends, but it also includes teachers, employers, and professionals in the field in which you want to work. The secret that every successful person knows is that no one succeeds on their own. Everyone owes their success to the help and guidance and support they received from others.</p>
        <p>Every award show you’ve ever seen is filled with happy or surprised people winning awards for their achievements in sports, music, or the arts. What they all share in common is gratitude. They all thank the people who were their support network.</p>
        <p>The good news is that you don’t have to worry about finding a support network because if you have a clear “vision” of where you want to go, a concrete and realistic “plan” for getting there, and can communicate your passion, drive, and “motivation” for achieving your goals, your support network will find you. In general, people want to help other people succeed.</p>
        <p>The actress Emma Stone (“The Amazing Spider Man,” “Easy A,” “House Bunny,” “Zombieland,” “The Help,” “LaLa Land”) wanted to act more than anything. At 15 years old she created a Powerpoint presentation in order to convince her parents to allow her to drop out of school, move to Los Angeles, and pursue acting. She had a vision. She knew she wanted to be an actor. She had a plan and she communicated that plan to her parents effectively. She was motivated and was willing to work hard even in the face of rejection. And, finally, she engaged her family and friends as a powerful support network to accomplish her goals.</p>
        <p>One of the goals of this online course is to help you get clear about your vision, develop a realistic plan for achieving it, access your motivation and increase your resilience, and create an effective support network. As you work though the readings and tasks, this should make more and more sense and become more and more real for you.</p>
        <p>To complete this reading, answer the questions below (and yes, you can scroll back and look for the right answer if you need to).</p>
