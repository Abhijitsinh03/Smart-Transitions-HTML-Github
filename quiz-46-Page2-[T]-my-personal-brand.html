                    <p>If you’re not sure whether your picks are accurate, ask a friend to give you feedback. If you have trouble picking six, ask a friend or family member to help you figure out your best qualities. Remember, we all have negative qualities
                        as well, but that isn’t what we are focusing on here. We are trying to highlight and reinforce our best qualities to actively create the brand we want to be known by. The thing about a personal brand is that it is something that
                        is within our power to influence. Even if we already have a personal brand that is more negative than positive, by identifying the aspects that we want to feature and reinforce, we can take an active role in developing our own
                        personal brand.</p>
                    <p>By the way, can you have more than six good qualities? Sure, but we want these to be more or deeper than a simple list you rattle off. We want these to be your best qualities, your most outstanding qualities, your strongest attributes.</p>
                    <p>Another way of getting at the qualities and characteristics that might make up your brand is to identify people you admire. They might be people you know personally, like family or friends, or they might be people you have never met like
                        celebrities or famous people. Make a list of what it is you admire about those people. For example: <i> “I admire my mother because she never gives up and is always there for us,” or “I admire my uncle because he built a successful business out of nothing,” or “I admire a particular athlete because he plays the game with his own sense of style,” or I admire a particular singer because her songs lift people up and make them feel good.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>The qualities we admire in others are often qualities we wish or hope that we possess.</p>
                    <h3>STEP TWO:</h3>
                    <p>Now take those six qualities that you identified above and/or any of the qualities that you admire in other people and turn each into a descriptive statement about yourself written in the third person. For example:</p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Chanelle is a really good friend to a close circle of people in her life. She is loyal and will always be there when those friends need her. She is patient and an excellent listener when her friends need to talk. She also offers wise advice and counsel and always seems to want to see her friends do well and be happy. Her friends know they can always count on her to be honest and tell them the truth as well.</i>
                        <br>OR <br>
                        <i>Danny is very athletic and is good at a number of sports. He is very competitive and determined. When he sets his mind to accomplish something, he doesn’t give up easily. He is friendly and easy going with a good sense of humor that helps people relax around him. He also a natural leader who can pull a team together and get them motivated to perform well.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>Imagine that you were writing the introduction you would like someone to use when introducing you to someone new or recommending you as a friend.</p>
