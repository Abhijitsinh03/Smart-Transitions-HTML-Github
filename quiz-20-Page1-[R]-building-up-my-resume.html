        <h2>Building Up My Resume</h2>
        <p>First of all, take a moment to feel good about yourself. You’ve completed about a quarter of this program and are closing in on having completed one of the most significant documents: a resume.</p>
        <p>Having made it this far, you should have a draft resume. How does it look? The first thing to think about is whether there are elements of your resume you’d like to improve upon. In some respects, a resume is always a draft version. It represents only where you are today. If you add a skill or award or certification or degree or an employment experience, you should update your resume. Your resume is only as good as it is current.</p>
        <p>Early in your career, your resume will look fairly generic and appropriate for a number of entry level positions. But, as you focus in on a career path, you want your resume to look more and more specific. You want it to describe the one person ideally suited to the job you are applying for—You!</p>
        <p>The most critical area to build up your resume is in your work experiences. You want a few solid work experiences that last more than a couple of weeks. On the other hand, too many work experiences can create a different challenge: explaining to a potential employer why you left or were terminated from so many positions. To build up your resume, consider the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure your work experiences highlight your duties effectively. Adjectives like excellent, efficient, friendly, reliable, award winning, etc. go a long way to making even basic duties appear more attractive. Don't assume that just because you listed a particular employer, everyone will know what your duties were. Dionne was a cashier at McDonalds but Tayquan provided friendly and courteous customer service as a cashier at McDonalds. Who would you hire?</li>
          <li>If you have no paid work experiences try to find some volunteer work and then focus on your duties in that position. Lisa volunteered at the youth center and managed games and activities for neighborhood children after school.</li>
          <li>If you already have numerous work experiences but they are all for a short duration, consider leaving some off your resume. Again, it is best to not have to explain why you left so many jobs after such a short time. Darrius dropped the two weeks he worked at Dairy Queen off his resume. He did not like the working environment and quit, but his next job was a better fit and he worked there for 14 months.</li>
          <li>Keep your education status up to date. If you have completed high school and are enrolled in college courses, you can list that, even if you have not yet earned a degree. Marcus resume lists that he is currently enrolled in the Associates Degree Program at the Community College.</li>
          <li>Have you added any certificates or certifications? These usually require less time than degrees and some can even be earned online. It makes you look good to be committed to learning and developing new skills. Amber hopes for a career in health care so her resume lists the first aid and CPR certification she just earned.</li>
          <li>Have you added any new skills? Keep your specific skill list up to date. Mike just completed an online course in a new computer programming language and so he added that to his resume.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, significant experiences like travel, performances, creative endeavors, and projects can be added to a resume if they help tell the story of what makes you unique. Starr spent her summer on a mission trip to Haiti helping rural villagers build a community center. Adding that to her resume shows her commitment to being of service and that she has traveled.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One way of thinking about your resume is that it should, at a glance, tell a story about a person who would make a really good employee. Does your resume do that? Is your resume specific enough? Does your resume help you stand out from the competition.</p>
        <form>
          <p>At some point you may decide for a different format for your resume or to create one based on a different template, but for now, if you want to revise or add to your Smart Transitions Online Resume, you just need to go back to your autobiographical data form that can be found behind the <input type="text" name="text" aria-label="text"> tab on your dashboard. After your initial resume has been approved by your mentor team you do not need to go through their approval process for every revision, but you can ask them to take a look at it if you choose.</p>
        </form>
        <p>To complete this reading, answer the question below (and yes, you can scroll back and look for the right answer if you need to).</p>
        <p>Identify the following statements as true or false based on the reading above:</p>
