                    <h2>Finding Your Heart—The Things That Describe Who You Are</h2>

                    <p>The heart of your portfolio will be a series of statements about who you are and what your abilities are. You are a unique and valuable combination of talents, skills, values and life experiences. You’ve done plenty of warm-up exercises
                        before getting to this point. Here are some links back to some of the work that will help you identify your core “Who I Am” statements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In upcoming tasks, we will help you learn how to create and/or upload the following items which will form the beginning of your portfolio:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My Gifts—Inventory</li>
                        <li>My Skills—Inventory</li>
                        <li>My Passions—Inventory</li>
                        <li>My Values—Inventory</li>
                        <li>Drafting a Life Work Vision</li>
                        <li>My Personal Brand</li>
                        <li>My Work Brand Worksheet </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It’s time to review these documents and the things you identified about yourself. Are there any areas that seem to dominate? For instance, do you like to work with people? Do you like to build things? Do you like to solve problems?
                        Do you like animals? Do you like to be outdoors? Do you like to express yourself creatively?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using a mix of your inventory worksheets, your Life-Work Vision statement, and your personal and work brand worksheets, make a list of statements that describe who you are. Narrow this list down to six to ten statements that strongly describe you and
                        for which you can provide evidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use the “Who I Am” worksheet below to create what will become a single page section header for your portfolio. Be direct and use complete sentences. For instance, “I am good at caring for sick people,” or “I have leadership ability.”
                        Then, in the box below that, provide written evidence for your statement. This might include a brief explanation and a list of the experiences you have had in “health care” or “leadership.”</p>
                    <p>Then use the evidence planner box below that to list the portfolio documents you have or want to get in support of this claim about yourself. What you write in this box will remain on this planner page but not show up when you publish
                        the “Who I Am” header page for your portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, try to find at least one photograph to support your statement. Continuing with the example above, you might include a photograph of yourself volunteering at a retirement facility or nursing home or leading a group of younger
                        children on a camping trip.</p>
                    <p>There is a sample below of a “Who I Am” worksheet filled in below that should make this process easier to understand. Take some time, and do these with care. They will be the core around which you organize your portfolio. All of the
                        other evidence you gather will be used to support these descriptions of who you are.</p>
                    <p>fter you complete your first “Who I Am” worksheet, when you click on the publish button it will generate a PDF version of this page that you can preview. It will live in your STO Gallery, ready to use to organize your digital portfolio
                        or print out for your print portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>You will want at least 4 “Who I Am” header pages to organize your portfolio contents. More than 10 is probably too much. You can create additional “Who I Am” header pages by clicking on the “New Who I Am Header Page” button and repeating
                        the process. You can do this up to 10 times before a dialog box will ask you to delete a previous “Who I Am Page.” Don't worry about the order you do them in now. Just create them. You can always reorganize them later.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can edit your “Who I Am” header pages by returning to this task and simply editing the text and the hitting the publish button again. This will replace your original with the edited version. Revising or updating your “Who I Am”
                        header pages is a good idea, You may want to update with new photos and new sample experiences. Getting to know yourself is an ongoing process. </p>

                    <p>Double check for spelling and grammar errors and make sure it reads the way you want it to. Then, when you are ready to make it into a document, click the Publish Button below. That will turn it into a PDF document that will be in
                        your STO Gallery. A preview image will pop up to show you how it looks. If you are satisfied, you can move on to create your next “Who I Am” header page. If not, you can come back and edit this statement and publish it again (which
                        will replace the original with a new document.</p>

                    <p>Remember that you need at least 4 statements to complete this task and you can create up to 10 here before having to choose to replace a previous statement.</p>
                    <p>Just to recap here. The purpose of these statements is to help you organize your evidence in a way that clearly and easily tells your story. The “Who I Am” statements are like the chapter titles for the story of who you are. Each one
                        highlights a different quality or aspect of who you are.</p>
