                    <h2>What Are References?</h2>
                    <p>We’ll keep this short and simple. References are people in the community who would say something positive about you and attest to your character as a person and/or an employee if called by a potential employer.</p>
                    <p>Your references are sometimes considered the page 2 of your resume. They are also often part of an employment application. A great reference is someone who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knows you well enough to speak to your good qualities.</li>
                        <li>Is more than just willing to say good things about you, but is actually enthusiastic about you.</li>
                        <li>Has some standing in the community (church, law enforcement, military, community leader, teacher, coach, business owner, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Has employed you or has some experience of you as a worker or an employee or a volunteer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finding references should not be that difficult, because the threshold for what is expected from them is fairly low. They just have to answer the phone and answer a few questions. In order to have an effective set of references you
                        need to do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plan your ask. Explain that you are taking this online course to be better prepared for work and part of the process includes the creation of a resume and a set of references. Most people will be impressed by your initiative and
                            effort.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make a list of people who would be good references. Make that list bigger than you need in case people turn you down. We will do that in the next task.</li>
                        <li>Approach people and ask them if they would agree to be references for you. Be polite and thank them even if they decline. Don't beg or plead with them. If you talk someone into being your reference, do you really want to trust
                            what they might say to an employer.</li>
                        <li>If they agree, ask them for the information included on your references planner task coming up. You want a phone number that is in working order and one they will answer.</li>
                    </ul>
