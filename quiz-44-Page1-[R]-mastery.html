                    <h3>Mastery</h3>
                    <p>Before we get too far away from the subject of investing in yourself, let’s consider another way that young people invest in themselves. Sometimes that investment takes the form of time and training. Some professions are based on acquiring
                        skills that, with diligence and some degree of aptitude, anyone can acquire. The best path for developing these skills is education and training. But for other professions, like professional sports or the martial arts or the visual,
                        musical, literary and performing arts and entertainment professions, what counts is talent and mastery. But what is mastery?
                    </p>
                    <p>Actually, we know what mastery entails. Scientists have broken down what it takes to actually master a discipline and it comes down to time and practice. It takes about 10,000 hours of training and practice at the sport or in the field
                        you want to compete in to be at the professional level in your field. Why 10,000 hours? Well, it takes time to build the kind of muscle memory that makes actions seem instinctive and intuitive. It takes that kind of time to translate
                        thinking about doing into doing. </p>
                    <p>10,000 hours? That’s about 5 solid hours of practice, working out, training, playing or performing every single day for the last five and a half years. That’s not just playing basketball, or baseball, or football in high school. That’s
                        probably living and breathing that sport for 5.5 years. </p>
                    <p><b>10,000 hours of quality training, practice, and play.</b> That’s what it means to play a sport at the professional level of the NBA, NFL, NHL, or the MLB? That’s what it means to be an Olympic quality or world-class athlete or martial
                        artist? </p>

                    <p>That’s also what it means to gain fame, respect, money, and success as an actor, musician, dancer, comedian, rapper, stand-up comic, singer, artist, filmmaker, photographer, writer, or poet? That’s what it means to be a recognized
                        expert or master craftsperson in a particular field? </p>
                    <p>The bad news in sports is that some of what it takes to play or compete at the professional or world-class level may be out of your control. Sports, in particular, requires certain physical capabilities (like height or percentage of
                        fast-twitch muscle fibers or the ability to convert oxygen efficiently or natural athletic ability) that you either were or were not born with. What is in your control is time and effort. </p>
                    <p>Experts in the field of mastery study tell us that it takes an average of 10,000 hours of solid practice before you have actually mastered something. That’s why so many people who are acknowledged as masters of their sport or art form
                        tend to be older. It isn't the age that brings the mastery though. It’s the time spent practicing and perfecting. Professional athletes and dancers who rely on their bodies are often in a race to perfect their physical form while
                        their bodies are adaptable enough to develop and heal and rebound from injury and the rigors of training. Older athletes often rely on a foundation of physical perfection combined with “playing smart” to compensate for deteriorating
                        physical capacity. </p>
                    <p>So if you are shooting for a career in which mastery matters how much time have you spent or do you spend on mastering your sport or art form? </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 hour a day, every day and you might be getting close to mastery in about 28 years.</li>
                        <li>2 hours a day, every day? Plan to spend about 14 years before you have mastered it. </li>
                        <li>3 hours a day, every day? Plan to spend about 9 year before you have mastered it. </li>
                        <li>4 hours a day, every day? Plan to spend about 7 years before you have mastered it. </li>
                        <li>5 hours a day, every day? Plan to spend about 5.5 years before you have mastered it. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Now, fortunately, if you really love what you are practicing, most of the time it isn’t going to feel like a burden to put that kind of time in, but even with a sport or art form you love, there will be times when it will feel like
                        work. At those times, having a good coach in your corner can be really helpful.</p>
                    <p>Again, this is not meant to depress you, but, rather to encourage you to be honest with yourself. A lot of people watch professional athletes or artists and they imagine themselves in that world. But those people got where they are
                        through a combination of natural ability and dedicated practice and time. It’s true that some people have played a sport so much and have so much natural ability that they are ready to play at a professional level at a young age.
                        But most professional athletes and artists will tell you that playing or competing at a professional level is not the same as true mastery. If you are going to make this kind of vision a reality, you need to be willing to invest
                        the time and effort in training and practice.</p>
