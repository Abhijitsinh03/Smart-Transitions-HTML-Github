                    <h2>The 5 Keys to an Amazing Life and Career</h2>
                    <p>The last thing we want to share with you are 5 things that universally lead to a life that is successful and fulfilling.</p>  
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find A Mentor: You’ve built a digital mentor team to help you with this course, but look for flesh and blood mentor as well. A mentor is a kind of coach for your life and career. It’s someone without a personal agenda for your life, who just wants to see you succeed and be happy. Ask almost any really successful person and they will tell you about the mentor or mentors who have guided them through particularly rough moments of their lives and careers.</li>
                        <li>Take Risks: No one likes to fail, but if you don’t fail occasionally it just means you aren’t living at your edge. Again, successful people will tell you that they learned much more from the things in their lives that failed than from those that succeeded easily.</li>
                        <li>Be A Lifelong Learner: Every person who has been successful for more than a moment has this in common: they’ve become lifelong learners. They are always studying, learning, practicing, and pushing themselves to get better and learn new skills. Take advantage of training opportunities at work or school.</li>
                        <li>Keep Your Work Life and Family Life In Balance: Successful people are often driven people. They have a strong desire to succeed, but sometimes this can come at the expense of family and relationship. Find a balance between work and family. The time that your children will actually be children is amazingly brief and you will never get those moments back. Cherish them. No one, on their death bed, ever wishes they’d made more money or spent more time at the office.</li>
                        <li>Find A Way To Give Back: Happy people are grateful people. They know they did not earn their success on their own. Express your gratitude. Compliment the people in your life. Find ways to be of service to those in need. Billionaire British entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson has said “There is no greater thing you can do with your life and your work than follow your passions in a way that serves the world and you.”</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Well that’s about it. No more quiz questions. Your progress bar is complete. </p>

                    <p>You’ve earned your badges of accomplishment and built real tools and skills that will help you succeed. Congratulations! When you click the button below, your completion certificate for this program will be generated automatically and located in your STO Gallery and you will be returned to your dashboard. Make sure to add it to your digital portfolio and print out a copy for your print portfolio. </p>

                    <p>The Smart Transitions Team at the Together We Can Foundation wishes you the best that life has to offer. </p>
