                    <h2>Keeping a job—How Committed Are You to the Job?</h2>

                    <p><i>My Brand: Gives 100% but makes it look easy, Doesn’t stand still, Takes on challenges, Keeps home and work life separate, Always makes his supervisor look good.</i></p>

                    <p>This one can be a challenge, especially if you don’t think much of the job you have and just view it as a way to earn a few bucks. But, this is where you really begin to get noticed if you choose to. Building a great work brand isn’t
                        easy, but it can really pay off professionally and financially down the road.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your challenge is to come across as giving 100% commitment to work and being really good at your job but always make it look easy. This first rule might seem a little crazy, but hang in there for a moment. Never talk about how
                            hard you’re working, even when it’s true. Why? Well, we may admire people who work hard, but we are amazed by people who make it seem effortless. So, while being the reliable hard worker or the amazing person who gets the work
                            done so well and makes it look so easy are both attractive, the second one tends to get noticed more often.</li>
                        <li>Don’t stand still at work. Stay busy. If you’ve finished everything you were supposed to do, help someone else out or take on a new project or do something extra, and don’t do it just when you think someone’s watching. If you’re
                            working a shift job, it makes time go much faster if you stay busy.</li>
                        <li>We can’t all do everything well, but if you challenge yourself to be the best person where you work at one or a couple of things, you will get noticed. Find a niche for yourself. That means find yourself a specialization. If you’re
                            new to a job, take a little while to study the set-up. Can you make yourself the “go-to” person for certain situations? How about figuring out the copier machine or solving computer problems? Sometimes that means taking on
                            a challenge other people don’t like doing. Don’t martyr yourself. Don’t take on jobs that no one values or needs. This is a strategic move. Take on a challenge that your supervisors are likely to notice.</li>
                        <li>Keep your personal life and your work life separate. This isn’t a hard and fast rule when it comes to sharing positive things about your personal life, but should be when it comes to negative things. If you’re fighting with your
                            boyfriend or girlfriend, turn your cell phone off before starting work. In the first place you shouldn’t be managing an interpersonal relationship that matters to you by text message. It never works out well. Your colleagues
                            may have some sympathy for you, but the moment that they have to cover for you, that good will is going to evaporate. Leave your personal issues in your employee locker.</li>
                        <li>Be a student of your workplace. That means that you ask questions about how things work and why they are done certain way. Be careful not to sound challenging when asking these questions, just be curious. Learn from the mistakes
                            of others. As a student of your workplace you will be well-placed to make the kinds of suggestions for improvements that will get you noticed.</li>
                        <li>Make your boss look good. Good bosses will love you for this and when they get promoted, they’re going to want to take you with them. But even bad bosses will appreciate that you are always making them look good. Good bosses will
                            praise you quite openly for how you make them look good. Bad bosses may try to keep your efforts a secret and take credit for your work. Don’t sweat it. Those kinds of situations don’t stay secret for long. The right people
                            will end up noticing you.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Right about now you might be thinking that this work stuff sounds like, well, like a lot of work.</p>

                    <p>You’re right. It isn’t easy and most people don’t bother. But then most people spend a lot of time complaining about how other people get all the breaks and opportunities and promotions and pay raises. Which kind of person do you want
                        to be?</p>

                    <p>Identify the following statements as true or false based on an employee who wants to be noticed in a positive way and be successful:</p>
