                    <h2>What is a Life-Work Plan?</h2>
                    <p>Remember back to one of your first readings: What do I need to be successful? Those four things were a vision, a plan, motivation, and a support network. Well a Life-Work Plan is a specific kind of plan designed to help you transition
                        to the adult life and career you want. A Life-Work Plan takes you from where you are now to where you want to get to. That’s true whether you plan on going to college, learning a trade or skill, joining the military, hoping to
                        play professional sports or even starting a business of your own.</p>
                    <p>Planning is a critical step in the process of finding success. After knowing where you want to go (your vision), having a well-defined plan is what will keep that vision from being just a fantasy or a daydream. Poor planning or no
                        planning is where most projects fail. Good plans are solid but not rigid. Your plan might describe getting accepted by a particular college or university. If that doesn’t happen, you go back and edit your plan to reflect the college
                        or colleges to which you did get accepted. You might plan on learning a specific trade and discover that you really don't like that trade and prefer acquiring a different skill set. That’s fine. You shouldn't be locked into a plan,
                        but you also shouldn’t abandon it every time something gets difficult. What matters is that you have a plan and that you do your best to stick to your plan.</p>
                    <p>It’s also important to note that, as you were growing up, it may be that no one expected you to plan or you never saw anyone plan things out, so this may all be new to you. But planning is a critical element of success in just about
                        every career you might imagine, so learning how to be an effective planner is a super-critical skill right now.</p>
                    <p>The Life-Work Plan you will be developing has some specific elements. First of all, it is based on a Life-Work Vision and not just a career path. We’ll explore your Life-Work Vision in future readings and tasks but for now, a Life-Work
                        Vision is a statement of how you want to utilize your best gifts and skills in a career that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>aligns with your values;</li>
                        <li>feeds your passions;</li>
                        <li>brings you the financial security or material wealth you aspire to; and
                        </li>
                        <li>serves a particular population.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The second thing that will define your Life-Work Plan is that it will contain action items—steps in a specific order that you can check off as you accomplish them. Having a checklist of action items gives you a way to track your progress
                        and provides a real sense of accomplishment. Plans need action items or steps in the order they need to be accomplished. That’s what makes it a workable plan. We’ll be looking at action items and how to create them in an upcoming
                        task.
                    </p>
                    <p>The third component of your plan is a timeline. Your action items should be time-bound—they should have a due date next to them. Again, the deadlines in a plan are not set in stone and sometimes need to be modified, but without a timeline,
                        it’s hard to know whether you are making progress according to the schedule you set for yourself.</p>
                    <p>In the end, your Life-Work Plan will be your map to success as you transition out of childhood and youth and into adult life and the workforce.</p>
